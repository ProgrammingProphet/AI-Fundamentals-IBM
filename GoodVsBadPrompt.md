Let’s break this down in a practical way, especially from the perspective of getting meaningful and accurate help from an AI like me(ChatGPT).

---

### ✅ **What is a Good Prompt?**

A **good prompt** is:

#### 1. **Clear**

* It explains exactly what you want.
* ✅ *Example:* “Explain how a for loop works in Python with an example for beginners.”

#### 2. **Specific**

* It avoids being too general or vague.
* ✅ *Example:* “Create a professional email informing my manager about my IBM AI Trainer certification, and attach four certificate names in the email.”

#### 3. **Contextual**

* It gives enough background so the AI understands the scenario.
* ✅ *Example:* “I’m a beginner in DevOps, and I want to learn Docker. Can you give me a basic roadmap and simple examples to get started?”

#### 4. **Goal-oriented**

* It shows what you want to achieve.
* ✅ *Example:* “I want to teach students about AI fundamentals. Give me 3 interactive classroom demonstrations in Hindi.”

#### 5. **Structured (when needed)**

* For technical queries, asking step-by-step or in bullet points works well.
* ✅ *Example:* “Give me step-by-step instructions to deploy a React app on Netlify.”

### ❌ **What is a Bad Prompt?**

A **bad prompt** is:

#### 1. **Too Vague**

* You don’t know what you're asking, and neither will the AI.
* ❌ *Example:* “Tell me something about AI.”

#### 2. **Too Broad**

* It tries to cover too much in one go.
* ❌ *Example:* “Teach me everything about Java.”

#### 3. **Lacks Context**

* Missing details make it hard to give the right response.
* ❌ *Example:* “Make a resume.”
  (Better: “Make a resume for a fresher Java developer applying to TCS.”)

#### 4. **Unclear Intent**

* It’s not clear what output is expected.
* ❌ *Example:* “Create presentation.”
  (Better: “Create a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation on Angular basics for college students.”)

#### 5. **Poorly Formatted or Unreadable**

* Unstructured blocks of text with no punctuation or clarity.
* ❌ *Example:* “hello im working on website its not working css not loading plz help fix fast”
